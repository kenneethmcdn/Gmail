## Why Multilogin Remains the Industry Leader

Whether it's diversifying e-commerce operations, handling multiple social media profiles, or scaling ad campaigns, Multilogin consistently sets the standard.

## Multilogin's Evolution: From Version 6 to Multilogin X

Multilogin now offers two versions of its software:
1. **Multilogin X**: The latest version with a web-accessible UI, significant architecture upgrades, and API-first design.
2. **Multilogin 6**: The older version, still available but receiving only essential updates. The company plans to retire this version by 2025, offering free migration to Multilogin X for existing users.

### Key Difference Between Multilogin X and Multilogin 6:
- **Browser Compatibility**: Multilogin X allows seamless use of profiles in browsers like Safari, Chrome, and Firefox without fingerprint inconsistencies. However, it still requires the desktop agent to run in the background.
- **Migration Plan**: Users of Multilogin 6 can switch to Multilogin X for free, ensuring uninterrupted access to the latest features.
