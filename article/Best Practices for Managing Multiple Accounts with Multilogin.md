## Step 1: Setting Up Your Profile

### Key Considerations
When creating a browser profile in Multilogin, keep the following points in mind:

- **Operating System:** Match the operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux) with your original OS to avoid fingerprint discrepancies.
- **Browser Profile Type:**  
  - *Mimic* (based on Chrome) and *Stealthfox* (based on Firefox) are both highly secure against detection.
- **Storage Type:**  
  - Choose **cloud storage** if you plan to collaborate with a team or use the same profile across multiple devices.

> Note: Profile settings cannot be changed after the profile is created.

### Advanced Settings
Multilogin automatically optimizes advanced settings for you. However, for tailored use cases, you can explore configuration options [here](https://multilogin.com/help/en_US/fingerprints).

## Step 2: Changing Your IP Address

The most reliable way to mask your IP address is by using proxies. Here's what you need to know:

- **Recommended Proxy Types:** Mobile or residential proxies work best for most use cases.
- **Multilogin Proxy Service:** Enjoy premium residential IPs for free with Multiloginâ€™s built-in proxy service. Learn more in [this FAQ](https://multilogin.com/help/proxies-and-ip-masking/multilogin-proxy-faq).
- **Third-Party Proxies:** If you use third-party proxies, ensure they are high-quality. Follow [this guide](https://multilogin.com/help/proxies-and-ip-masking/http-and-socks-proxies) to configure them.

## Step 3: Using Cookies

Browser fingerprints alone are not enough to avoid detectionâ€”**behavioral factors also play a critical role**. Adding cookies to every profile is an essential step to emulate regular browsing behavior.

### Why Cookies Are Important
- Platforms like Google and Facebook analyze cookies to determine user behavior.
- Without cookies, your browsing activity may appear suspicious, especially if you create an account without any browsing history.

To avoid triggering detection systems, build a history of visited websites before creating or logging into accounts.

## Step 4: Creating or Importing an Account

### Importing Existing Accounts
If youâ€™re importing an account, ensure the following:
- Match the browser type (*Mimic* for Chrome, *Stealthfox* for Firefox) and geolocation to the original environment where the account was created.
- Be cautious with purchased accounts, as their history may be unreliable. Trusted accounts from family or friends are a safer alternative.

### Creating New Accounts
When creating new accounts, follow these best practices:
- Use a **separate profile with a unique IP address** for each account.
- Ensure all registration details (e.g., names, emails, payment methods, phone numbers) are distinct for every account.
- Match the geolocation of your proxy with other details like phone numbers and payment methods.

## Step 5: Warming Up an Account

New accounts are often flagged by detection systems because they lack historical activity. To avoid issues, gradually build up the account:

- Perform activities that mimic normal user behavior.
- Avoid engaging in high-risk or repetitive actions immediately after account creation.
- Allow the account to age naturally by using it over a period of time before utilizing it for your specific goals.
